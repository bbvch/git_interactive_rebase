# Agile Principles

We follow these principles:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Some Nonsense
   I would rather not have commited.
   But we are editing this now

4. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
