# Agile Principles

We follow these principles:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
